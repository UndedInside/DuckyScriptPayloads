# Ducky Scripts
This is a collection of scripts that I have written in Ducky Script to be used in bad USBs.

## How is this organised?
Currently scripts are sorted by the target platform, so scripts to work on Windows computers are in the windows dir, Linux in the linux dir, etc.

## What do these do?
It depends on the script. I have tried to give these self-explanatory names, but there is also comments in the code to explain what each script does and what it's doing.

## How can I use these?
These scripts can be used on either the [USB Rubber Ducky](https://hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky) or the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/). For more detailed documentation, refer to the docs of each of these products. I will warn you that this repo was created with the Flipper Zero in mind (personally I just have this folder in my /badusb/ folder of the flipper - I think the folder structure is good for organisation) but it should work when compiled for the Ducky.

## How can I get help?
